****CHAPS CHALLENGE****


Welcome to Chaps Challenge! 

****How to play****

Arrow keys to move

Collect all the treasures to unlock the exit

**Level 1**

To complete level one, you must collect the coloured keys to unlock the doors.
This allows you to get all the treasures needed to complete the level.

**Level 2**

To complete level two, you must move the blocks to block the lava.
Make sure you watch out for the Cobra! The Cobra moves when you move so be careful!

****Record and Replay****

To record a game, select _Start recording_ from the menu bar. To save this recording hit _Save recording_.
You will also be prompted to save your recording if the game ends before you have saved it.

To replay a recording, hit _Play recording_ in the menu bar. You will be prompted to choose your json file to playback.

There is two playback modes. 

**Auto Play**

Autoplay will play through your recording, move by move. You can specify the speed the game is played back.

**Step by Step**

This mode allows you to step by the recording, one move at a time.
There is two buttons, step forward and step backwards.

Step Forwards:

Stepping forwards plays one move.

Step Backwards (EXPERIMENTAL)

This button is experimental, and should only be used in certain situations.
The button does not step the recording backwards, only the chaps location and the timer is.
This means that any items chap picks up, will remain in his inventory, and blocks moved will keep their location.
